						<p>After the nephew died without heirs in 1835, President Andrew Jackson informed Congress of the bequest, which amounted to 104,960 gold sovereigns, or US$500,000 ($10,100,997 in 2008 U.S. dollars after inflation). Given the age of the institution, many of the collections have great historical as well as scientific value, such as specimens collected by Darwin.  The museum is a world-renowned centre of research, specialising in taxonomy.The money was invested in shaky state bonds, which quickly defaulted gold sovereigns</p>

							<p>Here would go a short description of the project, the partners involved and the main objective. 
							Also we should invite users and institutions from here to participate on the project. This is gonna be
							 a beautiful project that is something we all think, and for sure is gonna be a real thing.</p>
							<p>The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near
							 future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for 
							 the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.</p>
